# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection using CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify brain MRI images and detect the presence of tumors. It is designed to assist medical professionals in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessing of MRI images (resizing, normalization, augmentation)
- CNN architecture for classification
- Training/validation pipeline with accuracy tracking
- Visualization of training performance (accuracy/loss graphs)
- Tumor prediction on new MRI scans

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset consists of MRI images categorized into classes indicating tumor presence. *(You can replace this with the actual dataset name and source if known.)*

## 📈 Results
Achieved high classification accuracy with reliable performance on unseen data. *(Add actual accuracy/metrics here if available.)*

## 🧪 Usage
1. Clone the repo  
2. Run the notebook: `PROJECT Brain Tumor Classification.ipynb`  
3. Modify or extend the model as needed
